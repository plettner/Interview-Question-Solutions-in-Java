Interview-Question-Solutions-in-Java
====================================

I'm writing Java solutions to some commonly asked Programming Interview Questions.

How To Run These Solutions
--------------------------

First, clone the project.

If you want to, you can run the tests (which put the solutions through their paces)
from the command line.  The project uses Maven, so one way to build all the 
solution classes and test them is to type

    mvn clean install
    
Alternatively, you can import the Maven project into Eclipse.  Then right click on
the project name, choose *Run As...* and then choose *JUnit Test*.
